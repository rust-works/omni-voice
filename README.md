## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install omni-voice

# Install with Nix
nix profile install github:rust-works/omni-voice

# Install with Nix flakes (development)
nix run github:rust-works/omni-voice
```

**Next step:** see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) — a
10-minute walkthrough from authentication to your first AI-improved
commit. (For just the API-key reference, see
[Authentication](docs/configuration.md#authentication).)

#### Shell Completion

`omni-voice completions <shell>` prints a completion script to stdout for
`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, or `elvish`. The quickest path is bash
per-user:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc:
eval "$(omni-voice completions bash)"
```

See [docs/shell-completion.md](docs/shell-completion.md) for per-shell install
recipes, the `$fpath`/`compinit` setup zsh requires, and troubleshooting.

### 📝 Atlassian Integration

Read, write, and manage JIRA issues and Confluence pages from the command line:

```bash
# Authenticate with Atlassian Cloud
omni-voice atlassian auth login

# Check authentication status
omni-voice atlassian auth status

# Fetch a JIRA issue as markdown
omni-voice atlassian jira read PROJ-123

# Fetch as raw ADF JSON
omni-voice atlassian jira read PROJ-123 --format adf

# Push markdown changes back to JIRA
omni-voice atlassian jira write PROJ-123 issue.md

# Interactive edit: fetch, edit in $EDITOR, push
omni-voice atlassian jira edit PROJ-123

# Search issues with JQL
omni-voice atlassian jira search --project PROJ --status Open

# Create an issue
omni-voice atlassian jira create issue.md --project PROJ --summary "Fix bug"

# Transition an issue
omni-voice atlassian jira transition PROJ-123 "In Progress"

omni-voice atlassian convert to-adf input.md
```

### 📊 Datadog Integration (read-only)

Authenticate against the Datadog API and query metrics, monitors, dashboards,
logs, events, SLOs, hosts, and downtimes. See the [Datadog integration
guide](docs/datadog.md) for the full subcommand reference, authentication
setup, rate-limit behaviour, and troubleshooting.

```bash
# Configure Datadog API credentials (prompts for API key, APP key, and site)
omni-voice datadog auth login

# Verify the credentials by calling /api/v1/validate
omni-voice datadog auth status

# Query metrics, monitors, dashboards, logs, and SLOs
omni-voice datadog metrics query --query 'avg:system.cpu.user{*}' --from 15m
omni-voice datadog monitor list --tags env:prod
omni-voice datadog dashboard list
omni-voice datadog logs search --filter 'service:api status:error' --from 1h
omni-voice datadog slo list --tags team:platform
```

`DATADOG_SITE` defaults to `datadoghq.com`. Other regions (`datadoghq.eu`,
`us3.datadoghq.com`, `us5.datadoghq.com`, `ap1.datadoghq.com`, `ddog-gov.com`)
are recognised without warning. Environment variables `DATADOG_API_KEY`,
`DATADOG_APP_KEY`, `DATADOG_SITE` override the stored settings. For on-prem
or proxied installs, set `DATADOG_API_URL` to override the site-derived URL.

All Datadog subcommands are also exposed as MCP tools (`datadog_*`) — see
[docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md#datadog-14-tools). For the full guide covering
every family with worked examples, see [docs/datadog.md](docs/datadog.md).

### 🎙️ Transcript Fetching

Pull captions and transcripts from external media platforms. YouTube is the
first supported source; the CLI namespace and library are designed so
additional sources (Vimeo, podcast RSS, generic VTT/SRT URLs) can be
added without restructuring. See [docs/transcript.md](docs/transcript.md)
for the full reference and the recipe for adding a new source.

```bash
# Fetch captions for a YouTube video as SubRip (default).
omni-voice transcript youtube fetch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw

# WebVTT to a file, falling through to auto-generated captions if needed.
omni-voice transcript youtube fetch jNQXAC9IVRw \
  --format vtt --auto --output me-at-the-zoo.vtt

# Synthesise a translated track when no native French track exists.
omni-voice transcript youtube fetch <url> --lang fr --translate fr

# List available caption tracks (manual + auto-generated).
omni-voice transcript youtube list-langs <url>

# Show video metadata (title, channel, duration, languages).
omni-voice transcript youtube info <url> --output json
```

`--format` accepts `srt`, `vtt`, `txt`, or `json`. Locators may be a
`watch?v=` URL, a `youtu.be/` short URL, a `/shorts/` or `/embed/` URL,
or a bare 11-character video ID. Age-gated and login-required videos
surface as a typed `PlayabilityRefused` error carrying YouTube's status
code rather than a generic HTTP failure.

### 🌐 Browser Bridge

Drive HTTP requests **through an authenticated browser tab**. When you are
investigating internal services (Grafana/Loki, internal dashboards, SSO-gated
admin panels), the browser already holds sessions — SSO, OAuth, cookies — that
are hard to replicate programmatically. The bridge issues requests inside the
browser's authenticated context **without exfiltrating cookies or tokens** (a
*confused deputy by design*). Both planes are authenticated and default-closed;
see [docs/browser-bridge.md](docs/browser-bridge.md) for the full guide and
[ADR-0036](docs/adrs/adr-0036.md) for the security rationale.

```bash
# Start the bridge; it prints the bound ports, a session token, and a JS
# snippet to paste into the DevTools console of the authenticated tab.
omni-voice browser bridge serve

# Drive requests through the tab (token from the bridge's stdout).
export OMNI_BRIDGE_TOKEN=<token printed by the bridge>
omni-voice browser bridge request --url /loki/api/v1/labels

# POST a JSON payload from a file, with a custom header.
omni-voice browser bridge request --url /api/foo --method POST \
  --body @payload.json --header "Accept: application/json"

# Stream a long-lived endpoint (SSE / chunked) instead of buffering.
omni-voice browser bridge request --url /api/events --stream

# Route to a specific tab when several are connected (by id or origin).
omni-voice browser bridge request --url /api/foo --target https://grafana.internal
```

Supports binary and streaming response bodies, multi-tab routing via
`X-Omni-Bridge-Target`, per-request `--credentials` and `--allow-origin`
overrides, and a transparent proxy for tools that speak plain HTTP.

### ✏️ Manual Amendment

```bash
# Apply specific amendments from YAML file
omni-voice git commit message amend amendments.yaml
```

### 🧩 Claude Code Slash-Commands

Generate ready-to-use Claude Code slash-command templates into the
project's `.claude/commands/` directory. Each template is a self-contained
workflow that drives a multi-step omni-voice operation from inside a Claude
Code session.

```bash
# Generate all templates: commit-twiddle, pr-create, pr-update
omni-voice commands generate all

# Or individually
omni-voice commands generate commit-twiddle
omni-voice commands generate pr-create
omni-voice commands generate pr-update
```

Each subcommand writes `.claude/commands/<name>.md`. Commit the files to
share the workflows with collaborators — Claude Code picks them up
automatically, so anyone in the repo can invoke `/commit-twiddle`,
`/pr-create`, or `/pr-update` inside a Claude Code session. See the
[user guide](docs/user-guide.md#commands-generate--generate-claude-code-slash-commands)
for the full reference.

### 🗒️ Claude Conversation History

Export your Claude Code chat history to a directory of `.jsonl` files for
behavioural analysis, work-log generation, or downstream tooling. Re-running
acts as an idempotent sync: new chats are added, modified chats are
overwritten, unchanged chats are skipped.

```bash
# Mirror ~/.claude/projects to ./history/ (one .jsonl per chat, grouped by project slug)
omni-voice ai claude history sync --target ./history

# Limit to one project (encoded slug or decoded cwd path)
omni-voice ai claude history sync --target ./history --project /Users/me/work/repo

# Only sessions touched in the last week
omni-voice ai claude history sync --target ./history --since 7d

# Preview without writing, then prune target files for sessions removed upstream
omni-voice ai claude history sync --target ./history --dry-run --prune

# Render LLM-friendly markdown alongside the raw jsonl (one .md per session)
omni-voice ai claude history sync --target ./history --output-format jsonl,markdown

# Markdown only — suitable for piping into a coaching LLM
omni-voice ai claude history sync --target ./history --output-format markdown
```

The export is a **behavioural transcript**, not a faithful archive. The
top-level session jsonl captures all prompts, responses, thinking blocks, tool
calls, and tool-result metadata — the signal needed for analysis. Sub-agent
internal turns, large tool-output sidecars, PDF page rasters, and Claude's
auto-memory are deliberately excluded; they would bloat any LLM-ingested
corpus without adding interaction-pattern signal.

In-progress chats produce a valid jsonl prefix (the source size is captured
once at the start of the copy), so you can sync safely while a chat is open.
The target layout mirrors the source — `<target>/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl` — and
source `mtime` is preserved on each target file so downstream tooling can
sort sessions chronologically without parsing every file.

`--output-format markdown` writes a derived `<target>/<slug>/<uuid>.md`
alongside (or instead of) the jsonl. Each markdown file has YAML frontmatter
with session metadata followed by `## User` / `## Assistant` turns; tool calls
render as `### Tool call: <name>` blocks, thinking blocks collapse into
`<details>`, and sub-agent (`Agent`) calls render the prompt argument only.

Agent-to-user interactions are surfaced as first-class structured events so
the analyst LLM sees what was actually asked and how the user responded:

- `AskUserQuestion` calls render as `### Agent question: <header>` with the
  question text and a bulleted list of options (with descriptions); the
  paired user reply renders as `## User response`.
- Tool denials show up as `**Tool result (<tool>, denied by user):**` —
  detected by the canonical "The user doesn't want to proceed with this tool
  use" sentinel Claude Code stuffs into the next `tool_result`.
- Tool interrupts (escape mid-execution) render as
  `**Tool result (<tool>, interrupted by user):**`.
- Errors (real tool failures, distinct from user denials) keep the
  `error` label; successes use `ok`.

System reminders, attachments, and permission-mode events are included by
default — pass `--exclude-system` to drop them. Markdown idempotency keys off
source mtime alone (the rendered length differs from the source length), and
`--prune` only deletes artifacts whose extension matches one of the formats
listed in `--output-format`.

See [docs/user-guide.md#ai-claude-history-sync--export-conversation-history](docs/user-guide.md#ai-claude-history-sync--export-conversation-history)
for the in-depth reference, and the broader [Claude Code Integration](docs/user-guide.md#claude-code-integration)
section for related commands (`ai chat`, `ai claude skills`).

### 🔌 MCP Server

omni-voice ships an optional **Model Context Protocol** server so AI assistants
(Claude Desktop, Claude Code, the MCP Inspector, custom agents) can call
omni-voice over stdio instead of shelling out to the CLI. The server is
delivered as a second binary, `omni-voice-mcp`, gated behind the `mcp` Cargo
feature (see [ADR-0021](docs/adrs/adr-0021.md)).

Tools cover six domains:

| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Git** (5) | `git_view_commits`, `git_branch_info`, `git_check_commits`, `git_twiddle_commits`, `git_create_pr` |
| **JIRA** (28) | core read/write/search/transition/comment/link/dev/delete; sprints, boards, watchers, worklogs, fields, attachments, projects, changelog |
| **Confluence** (13) | read/write/search/create/delete/download/children, comments, labels, user search |
| **Atlassian shared** (2) | `atlassian_auth_status`, `atlassian_convert` (offline JFM ↔ ADF) |
| **Datadog** (14) | metrics, monitors, dashboards, logs, events, SLOs, hosts, downtimes, metrics catalog |
| **AI / Config** (5) | `ai_chat` (one-shot chat), `claude_skills_*` (sync / clean / status for `.claude/skills/` distribution), `config_models_show` |

Resources exposed via URI templates:

| URI template                    | Returns                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `git://repo/commits/{range}`    | YAML commit analysis             |
| `jira://issue/{key}`            | JIRA issue as JFM                |
| `jira://issue/{key}.adf`        | JIRA issue body as ADF           |
| `confluence://page/{id}`        | Confluence page as JFM           |
| `confluence://page/{id}.adf`    | Confluence page body as ADF      |
| `omni-voice://specs/{name}`       | Embedded reference specs (e.g. `jfm`) |

See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md) for the full tool catalog, resource
reference, cross-cutting parameters (`output_file`, `confirm`), and
troubleshooting.

#### Install

```bash
cargo install omni-voice --features mcp
```

This adds a second binary, `omni-voice-mcp`, alongside the regular `omni-voice`
CLI. The default `cargo install omni-voice` build is unchanged — no MCP
dependencies are pulled in unless the `mcp` feature is enabled.

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on
macOS (or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omni-voice": {
      "command": "omni-voice-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code

Per-project — create `.mcp.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omni-voice": {
      "command": "omni-voice-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or register globally with the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add omni-voice omni-voice-mcp
```

#### Smoke-test with the MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector omni-voice-mcp
```

The Inspector opens a browser UI where you can list tools and resources,
call any tool interactively, and fetch resources against the current working
directory.

For troubleshooting (stderr logs, `RUST_LOG=debug`, "failed to open git
repository"), see [docs/mcp.md#troubleshooting](docs/mcp.md#troubleshooting).

### ⚙️ Configuration Commands

```bash
# Show supported AI models and their specifications
omni-voice config models show

# View model information with token limits and capabilities
omni-voice config models show | grep -A5 "claude-opus-4.1"
```

## 🧠 Contextual Intelligence

omni-voice understands your project context to provide better suggestions:

### Project Configuration

Create `.omni-voice/` directory in your repo root:

```bash
mkdir .omni-voice
```

#### Scope Definitions (`.omni-voice/scopes.yaml`)

```yaml
scopes:
  - name: "auth"
    description: "Authentication and authorization systems"
    examples: ["auth: add OAuth2 support", "auth: fix token validation"]
    file_patterns: ["src/auth/**", "auth.rs"]
  
  - name: "api"
    description: "REST API endpoints and handlers"  
    examples: ["api: add user endpoints", "api: improve error responses"]
    file_patterns: ["src/api/**", "handlers/**"]
```

#### Commit Guidelines (`.omni-voice/commit-guidelines.md`)

```markdown
# Project Commit Guidelines

## Format
- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

## Our Scopes
- `auth` - Authentication systems
- `api` - REST API changes
- `ui` - Frontend/UI components
```

## 🎯 Advanced Features

### Intelligent Context Detection

omni-voice automatically detects:

- **Project Conventions**: From `.omni-voice/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Work Patterns**: Feature development, bug fixes, documentation,
  refactoring
- **Branch Context**: Extracts work type from branch names
  (`feature/auth-system`)
- **File Architecture**: Understands UI, API, core logic, configuration
  changes
- **Change Significance**: Adjusts detail level based on impact

### Automatic Batching

Large commit ranges are automatically split into manageable batches:

```bash
# Processes 50 commits in batches of 4 (default)
omni-voice git commit message twiddle 'HEAD~50..HEAD' --use-context

# Custom concurrency for very large ranges
omni-voice git commit message twiddle 'main..HEAD' --concurrency 2
```

### Command Options

| Option | Description | Example |

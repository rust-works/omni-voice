# JFM (JIRA-Flavored Markdown) Specification

## Overview

JFM provides bidirectional conversion between Markdown and Atlassian Document
Format (ADF), enabling JIRA Cloud issues and Confluence Cloud pages to be
read, edited, and updated as local markdown files.

## JFM Document Format

A JFM document consists of YAML frontmatter followed by a markdown body,
separated by `---` delimiters. The `type` field in the frontmatter
discriminates between JIRA and Confluence content.

### JIRA Issue

```markdown
---
type: jira
instance: https://myorg.atlassian.net
key: PROJ-123
summary: Issue title here
status: In Progress
issue_type: Story
assignee: Alice Smith
priority: High
labels:
  - backend
  - auth
---

Markdown body content describing the issue.
```

### Confluence Page

```markdown
---
type: confluence
instance: https://myorg.atlassian.net
page_id: "12345"
title: Architecture Overview
space_key: ENG
status: current
version: 7
---

Page body content here.
```

### JIRA Frontmatter Fields

| Field        | Required | Description                                                               |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`       | Yes      | Always `"jira"`                                                           |

| `key`        | No       | JIRA issue key (e.g., `PROJ-123`). Absent when creating a new issue.      |
| `project`    | No       | Project key (e.g., `PROJ`). Used for issue creation when `key` is absent. |
| `summary`    | Yes      | Issue title/summary                                                       |
| `status`     | No       | Issue status (read-only from JIRA)                                        |
| `issue_type` | No       | Issue type (Bug, Story, Task, etc.)                                       |
| `assignee`   | No       | Assigned user display name                                                |
| `priority`   | No       | Issue priority level                                                      |
| `labels`     | No       | List of issue labels                                                      |

### Confluence Frontmatter Fields

| Field        | Required | Description                                          |
|--------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`       | Yes      | Always `"confluence"`                                |
| `instance`   | Yes      | Atlassian Cloud instance URL                         |
| `page_id`    | No       | Confluence page ID. Absent when creating a new page. |
| `title`      | Yes      | Page title                                           |
| `space_key`  | Yes      | Space key (e.g., `ENG`)                              |
| `status`     | No       | Page status (`"current"` or `"draft"`)               |
| `version`    | No       | Page version number (for optimistic locking)         |
| `parent_id`  | No       | Parent page ID                                       |

### Issue Key Validation

Issue keys must match the pattern `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+$`:
- Starts with an uppercase letter
- Followed by uppercase letters or digits
- A hyphen
- One or more digits

### Parsing Rules

- Frontmatter must begin at the first line with exactly `---`
- Frontmatter ends at the next `---` on its own line
- The body may safely contain `---` (only the first occurrence after the
  opening delimiter closes the frontmatter)
- Empty body is valid
- Trailing newlines are preserved
- Optional fields omitted from YAML when `None` or empty

## Atlassian Document Format (ADF)

ADF is JIRA's native rich-text format. JFM converts between markdown and
ADF v1.

### ADF Structure

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "type": "doc",
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "Hello " },
        { "type": "text", "text": "world", "marks": [{ "type": "strong" }] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| `border`          | On media/table cells: `border-color=#hex border-size=N` |

### Unsupported Node Handling

ADF nodes that cannot be represented in markdown are serialized as fenced
code blocks with language `adf-unsupported`:

````markdown
```adf-unsupported
{"type":"unknownNode","attrs":{"key":"value"}}
```
````

On conversion back to ADF, these blocks are deserialized and restored to
their original ADF structure, enabling lossless round-trips for unsupported
content.

## Content Model Constraints

ADF uses a strict content model: each container node permits only a specific
set of child node types, and each parent's content sequence is constrained by
quantifiers (`?`, `*`, `+`, `{n}`, `{m,n}`). Atlassian's APIs reject
documents that violate the model, often as an opaque HTTP 500 with no
indication of which nesting was at fault. JFM directives parse permissively —
`:::expand` inside `:::panel` produces well-formed ADF, but the API will
refuse it.

### Source of truth

The full content model for every container node is encoded in
[`src/atlassian/adf_schema/mod.rs`](../../src/atlassian/adf_schema/mod.rs),
transcribed faithfully from the upstream `@atlaskit/adf-schema` npm package
per [ADR-0023](../adrs/adr-0023.md). The pinned upstream version is recorded
in the `SCHEMA_VERSION` and `UPSTREAM_TARBALL_SHA256` constants in that
module. Treat the module as authoritative; the prose below is illustrative.

Public helpers expose the model:

- `adf_schema::allowed_children(parent)` — returns the union of allowed
  direct children for a parent node type, or `None` for leaf / unknown
  types.
- `adf_schema::content_model(parent)` — returns the full sequence of
  quantified content terms for a parent (preserves ordering and arity).
- `adf_schema::permits_child(parent, child)` — `true` if `child` is permitted
  as a direct child of `parent`. Permissive on unknown parents (returns
  `true`) so that future Atlassian node types do not break round-trips.
- `adf_schema::validate_document(&doc)` — depth-first walker that returns
  every nesting **and** arity violation in document order, with
  `parent_type`, `child_type` (or quantifier diagnostic), and an index path
  from the document root.

### Enforcement on writes

The validator is wired into every JFM-driven write path so violations abort
locally with a clear diagnosis instead of producing an opaque HTTP 500:

- `adf_validated::ValidatedAdfDocument::try_new` is the only constructor for
  the `ValidatedAdfDocument` newtype that the Confluence and JIRA write APIs
  accept, making "I forgot to validate" a compile error.
- `omni-voice confluence write` and `omni-voice confluence create` (and their
  MCP tool equivalents) print every violation via the dry-run helper before
  any network call.
- On HTTP 500 from a Confluence write that did pass local validation, the
  client re-runs `validate_document` against the submitted body and attaches
  the first violation (with a hint from `adf_hints::hint_for`) to the error
  via `AtlassianError::ApiRequestFailedWithDiagnosis`.

### Common pitfalls

These illustrate the kinds of constraint the schema encodes; they are not an
exhaustive list. Consult the schema module for the full set.

- **`panel`** does not permit `expand`, `nestedExpand`, `panel`,
  `bodiedExtension`, `blockquote`, `layoutSection`, or `table`. Its content
  is paragraphs, headings, lists (bullet, ordered, decision, task), code
  blocks, media, rules, extensions, and block cards.
- **`expand`** does not permit another `expand`, but **does** permit
  `nestedExpand` as a child. It also does not permit `bodiedExtension` or
  `layoutSection`.
- **`nestedExpand`** has a tighter content model than `expand`: it does not
  permit `expand`, `nestedExpand`, `table`, `blockCard`, `embedCard`, or
  `bodiedExtension`. It **does** permit `panel` and `blockquote`.
- **`tableCell`** and **`tableHeader`** permit `nestedExpand` but **not**
  `expand`. They also do not permit nested `table` or `layoutSection`. Use
  `:::nested-expand` instead of `:::expand` inside table cells.
- **`blockquote`** is restrictive: it permits paragraphs, lists (bullet,
  ordered), code blocks, media, and extensions only. It does not permit
  headings, tables, panels, expands, decision lists, task lists, or further
  blockquotes.
- **`listItem`** permits paragraphs, code blocks, media, extensions, and
  nested lists (bullet, ordered, task). It does not permit headings,
  blockquotes, panels, expands, decision lists, tables, or layout sections.
- **`layoutSection`** permits only `layoutColumn` children — layout sections
  cannot be nested directly. Use multiple `:::column`s within a single
  `::::layout` instead.
- **`decisionItem`** and **`taskItem`** are inline-only — they cannot
  contain block content.

### Workarounds

When the desired nesting is rejected, common rewrites are:

- **`expand` inside `panel`**: invert the nesting (place the panel inside
  the expand), or render the two as siblings.
- **`expand` inside a table cell**: use `:::nested-expand` instead.
- **List, decision, or task list inside `> blockquote`**: render the quoted
  text as a paragraph and place the list as a sibling block.
- **Nested layout sections**: collapse to a single `::::layout` with
  multiple `:::column` children.
- **Rich blocks (expand, panel, layout) inside a table cell**: keep them as
  siblings of the table rather than embedding them.

### Forward-compatibility notes

- `unsupportedBlock` and `unsupportedInline` (the runtime preservation
  wrappers behind the `adf-unsupported` fenced block) are accepted under any
  parent by the validator, regardless of the parent's allowed-children set,
  and count toward the parent's arity. This preserves the round-trip
  guarantee from [ADR-0020](../adrs/adr-0020.md) for nodes the snapshot
  does not yet model.
- Unknown parent node types are treated permissively: their subtrees are
  not walked. A future Atlassian node type therefore does not become a
  validation failure until its content model is added to the schema.

### Coverage and limits

As of `SCHEMA_VERSION 52.9.5-2026-05-10`, the validator covers:

- Allowed-children sets for every container node type.
- Per-term quantifiers and content-term sequences (e.g. empty `bulletList`,
  two-`media` `mediaSingle`, or a `layoutSection` with one column are all
  reported as `AdfSchemaViolation::Arity`).

Out of scope and not enforced:

- Mark whitelists (which marks may apply to which nodes).
- Attribute-value schemas (allowed values for `panel.type`, `status.color`,
  etc.).

## Generic Directive System

JFM uses the CommonMark Generic Directives proposal to represent ADF-specific
constructs that have no native markdown equivalent. Three directive levels
are supported:

### Inline Directives

Syntax: `:name[content]{attrs}`

Used for inline semantic elements within text:

```markdown
The status is :status[In Progress]{color=blue} and assigned to
:mention[Alice]{id=abc123}.

The deadline is :date[2026-04-15].

Click the :placeholder[Type something...] field to begin.

See :media-inline[]{type=file id=UUID collection=NAME} for details.
```

- Content in `[...]` is **required**
- Attributes in `{...}` are optional
- Name must be alphabetic characters and hyphens

### Leaf Block Directives

Syntax: `::name[content]{attrs}`

Used for standalone block-level elements:

```markdown
::card[https://example.com/page]{width=80}
```

- Exactly two colons (not three)
- Content in `[...]` is optional
- Must occupy its own line

### Container Directives

Syntax: `:::name{attrs}` ... `:::`

Used for block-level containers wrapping other content:

```markdown
:::panel{type=info}
This is an informational panel with **rich** content.

- Item one
- Item two
:::
```

- Three or more colons to open
- Closed by matching colon count with no name
- Content between open/close is parsed as markdown
- Attributes are optional

### Attribute Syntax

Attributes follow Pandoc-style `{key=value flag}` syntax:

```
{type=info}                          # simple key-value
{color="bright red"}                 # quoted value with spaces
{bg=#DEEBFF numbered}               # mixed key-value and flag
{title="Click to expand"}           # quoted string
{params='{"jql":"project=PROJ"}'}   # single-quoted JSON value
```

- Keys: alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores
- Values: unquoted (stop at whitespace/`}`) or quoted (single/double)
- Flags: bare words treated as boolean true
- Round-trip safe: `parse -> render -> parse` preserves structure

## Markdown to ADF Conversion

The converter uses a line-oriented parser that processes blocks in order:

1. Headings (`# ` through `###### `)
2. Horizontal rules (`---`, `***`, `___`)
3. Container directives (`:::name{attrs}` ... `:::`)
4. Fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``)
5. Tables (pipe-delimited with separator row)
6. Blockquotes (`> `)
7. Lists (`- `, `* `, `1. `, `- [ ] `, `- [x] `)
8. Leaf directives (`::name[content]{attrs}`)
9. Images (`![alt](url)`)
10. Paragraphs (default fallback)

Inline content within paragraphs is parsed for:
- Bold, italic, code, strikethrough
- Links and bare URLs
- Inline directives (status, date, mention, emoji)
- Bracketed spans with attributes (`[text]{color=red}`, `[text]{annotation-id=...}`)

### ADF to Markdown

Block nodes are rendered to their markdown equivalents. Inline nodes
have marks applied (bold, italic, etc.) and semantic nodes render as
directives.

### Block Attributes

Block-level attributes can follow a block on a separate line:

```markdown
# Section Title
{align=center breakout=wide}
```

Supported attributes: `align`, `indent`, `breakout`.

### Inline Attribute Marks

Bracketed spans `[text]{attrs}` represent inline marks that have no native
markdown syntax. Multiple attributes can be combined in a single span.

#### Underline

```markdown
[underlined text]{underline}
```

#### Annotation (Inline Comments)

Confluence inline comments attach an `annotation` mark to highlighted text.
The mark links the text span to a comment thread stored in Confluence's
comment system. JFM preserves these marks for round-trip fidelity:

```markdown
[highlighted text]{annotation-id="abc123" annotation-type=inlineComment}
```

- `annotation-id`: the annotation identifier (required)
- `annotation-type`: the annotation type, typically `inlineComment` (required)
- Annotations can coexist with other marks (bold, italic, etc.):
  `[**bold comment**]{annotation-id="abc123" annotation-type=inlineComment}`

## Table Rendering Modes

Tables use one of two rendering modes depending on cell complexity:

### Pipe Tables (GFM)

Used when all cells contain simple inline content (single paragraph, no hard
breaks, no cell-level marks, no paragraph localIds) and the first row has at
least one `tableHeader`:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| cell | cell |
```

### Directive Tables

Used when any cell contains complex content (multiple paragraphs, hard breaks,
code blocks, nested lists, border marks, or paragraph-level localIds):

```markdown
::::table{layout=default}
:::tr
:::th{colspan=2}
Header spanning two columns
:::
:::
:::tr
:::td{border-color=#091e42 border-size=2}
Cell with border mark
:::
:::td
Simple cell
:::
:::
::::
```

Table-level attributes include `layout`, `width`, `numbered`/`numbered=false`,
and `isNumberColumnEnabled`.

## Media Nodes

### `mediaSingle` with Image

File-hosted media:

```markdown
![alt](){type=file id=UUID collection=NAME width=N height=N}
```

The `occurrenceKey` attribute is preserved when present on the ADF `media`
node:

```markdown
![alt](){type=file id=UUID collection=NAME occurrenceKey=KEY width=N height=N}
```

External media:

```markdown
![alt](https://example.com/image.png){layout=center width=600}
```

### `mediaSingle` with Caption

A `:::caption` block immediately following the image line attaches a caption
to the `mediaSingle` node:

```markdown
![alt](){type=file id=UUID collection=NAME}
:::caption{localId=abc123}
Caption text with **formatting**
:::
```

The caption's `localId` is optional.

### `mediaInline`

Inline media uses the `:media-inline` directive:

```markdown
Text with :media-inline[]{type=file id=UUID collection=NAME} embedded.
```

For external inline media:

```markdown
Text with :media-inline[]{type=external url=https://example.com/file.pdf alt=document} here.
```

### Border Mark on Media

The `border` mark on a media node is expressed as additional attributes on the
image:

```markdown
![alt](){type=file id=UUID collection=NAME border-color=#091e4224 border-size=2}
```

When parsing, `border-color` defaults to `#000000` and `border-size` defaults
to `1` when only one is present.

## `localId` Preservation

Many ADF nodes carry a `localId` attribute used by JIRA and Confluence for
task item state tracking, inline comment anchoring, and other stateful
features. JFM preserves these for round-trip fidelity.

### Syntax

For directive-based nodes, `localId` appears as an attribute:

```markdown
:::expand{title="Details" localId=abc-123}
Content here
:::
```

For standard markdown nodes (headings, paragraphs), `localId` appears on a
trailing block-attributes line:

```markdown
# Section Title
{localId=abc-123}
```

For list items, `localId` is appended inline to avoid misattribution to the
parent list node:

```markdown
- Item text {localId=item-id paraLocalId=para-id}
```

The `paraLocalId` attribute preserves the localId of a `paragraph` wrapper
inside a `taskItem` when the original ADF used paragraph children rather than
direct inline content.

### Suppression

- Null UUIDs (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`) and empty strings are
  suppressed during rendering.
- The `strip_local_ids` render option omits all localIds for clean display
  output where round-trip fidelity is not needed.

### Special Cases

- `expand` and `nestedExpand` store `localId` as a top-level ADF field
  (`node.local_id`) rather than inside `attrs`. JFM renders it in the
  directive attributes alongside `title` and `params`.
- `listItem` nodes with a `mediaSingle` first child preserve their `localId`
  in the trailing inline attributes.

## Text Escaping for Round-Trip Safety

Plain text that would be reinterpreted by the markdown parser on the return
trip is escaped during ADF-to-markdown rendering. Each escape targets a
specific ambiguity:

| Pattern                | Escape                    | Prevents                                  |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `*` in text            | `\*`                      | Spurious bold/italic                      |
| `` ` `` in text        | `` \` ``                  | Spurious code spans                       |
| `[` `]` in link text   | `\[` `\]`                 | Link syntax ambiguity                     |
| `http://` `https://`   | `\http://`                | Auto-link / inlineCard detection          |
| `:name:` in text       | `\:name:`                 | Emoji shortcode parsing                   |
| Trailing double-spaces | `\ ` (escaped last space) | `hardBreak` misinterpretation             |
| `\` in text            | `\\`                      | Silent backslash consumption              |
| Literal newline in text| `\n` (two characters)     | Paragraph splitting                       |
| `N. ` at line start    | `N\. `                    | Ordered list re-parsing (in continuations)|
| `- ` at line start     | `\- `                     | Bullet list re-parsing (in continuations) |

Escaping is applied only outside code spans and fenced code blocks, where the
markdown parser would otherwise reinterpret the content.

## Authentication

- **Method**: HTTP Basic Auth (base64-encoded `email:api_token`)
- **Credential sources** (checked in order):
  1. Environment variables
  2. `~/.omni-voice/settings.json` `env` map
- **Required keys**:
  - `ATLASSIAN_INSTANCE_URL`
  - `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`
  - `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`
- Same credentials serve both JIRA and Confluence (same Atlassian instance)

## Error Types

| Error                  | Cause                                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `CredentialsNotFound`  | No credentials configured                      |
| `ApiRequestFailed`     | HTTP error from API (includes status + body)   |
| `InvalidDocument`      | JFM parse error (bad YAML, missing delimiters) |
| `ConversionError`      | ADF conversion failure                         |
